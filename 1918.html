            <p> Hey dear readers! 👋
			I just want to share my Tuesday. Tuesdays are usually the hardest days in school because we have a lot of classes, and some of them are very hard and tiring.

I usually start my Tuesdays with a nice breakfast, then I brush my teeth, put on my cologne, and go to school.

Classes usually begin at 8:30 AM, and we cover subjects like English, Russian, Physics, and Math.

At 12:45 PM, we have lunch. After school, I either go home or stay a little longer to play basketball with my friends.

At home, I rest, but not for long because I often have homework. After finishing my homework, I play video games with my friends, and at 11:30 PM, I go to sleep.
